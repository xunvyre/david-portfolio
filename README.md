# David Designs Portfolio

## Purpose
A portfolio site to showcase personal and professional works. Changes that I included from the provided mockup to suit my personal tastes include:

* larger font sizes
* a new color palette
* more color variation
* and a pfp (required in the assignment but not present in the mock-up).

I decided to include the work section images in the HTML so that I could add alts, even though it probably would have been easier to add them to the CSS.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
